The Galaxy, formally known as The Milky Way is a barred spiral galaxy dominated by 2 arms wrapping off of the central bar of stars.  The Galaxy is the only known source of material life and is inhabited by numerous different intelligent races creating the [[Galactic Community]]. 

## Structure

The Galaxy is roughly 87,400 [[Galactic Standards|Light Years]] (26.8 [[Galactic Standards|Kiloparsecs]]) as well as 1,000 ly thick. While The Galaxy contains over 200 billion stars, only roughly 20 systems are accessible by the [[Corridor System]] rendering most systems inaccessible to all but the most dedicated of [[Pathfinders|explorers]]. The Galaxy also contains ~20,000 [[Nebulae|nebulae]] with 2 of them being connected to the [[Corridor System]], namely the [[Sidexa Veil]] and [[Pleiades Nebula]]. 

All [[Galactic Standards|official]] starmaps depict The Galaxy from a top down view using angle of longitude based from the galactic center (0=North, 180=South, 270=East, 90=West).
