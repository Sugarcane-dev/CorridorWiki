## Makeup 

Located within the Solar System, Earth is a Continental World who's surface is dominated mainly by large oceans of salt water. Being the third planet from the star [[Sol]], Earth enjoys relatively stable temperatures and access to solar power.

## Climate

The climate of Earth varies greatly depending on location due to mass industrialization, geographical factors, fallout of wars past, and the notorious destruction of the [[ESA]]. 

Most lands within the [[Europan Union]] enjoy a relatively humid and temperate climate with frequent precipitation thanks mainly to the terraforming efforts of 2118 CE (99 [[Galactic Standards|BPN]]). Some areas like the Gobi and Sahara Desert remained arid deserts due to protests by locals and as such are frequent tourist destinations by much of the [[Europan Union]]. 

The American Continent is frequently divided into the northern landmass and southern landmass when referring to climate due to the radically different histories of the area. 

The [[ESA]] is notorious for its acidic climate despite desperate climate restoration attempts. Most of the eastern seaboard suffers from an air quality of 71.5 - 118.9 PM2.5 (μg/m³). This can be mainly attributed to the [[First Contact War]] and the ensuing destruction of the former capital of the [[Earth Protectorate]], [[The Crater|Washington DC]]. Temperatures in the region range from 10C to 40C.

## Culture

The population of Earth is divided mainly between the [[Europan Union]] of the super continent Afro-Eurasia and the American Continent which harbors numerous different cultures. While the [[Earth Protectorate]] performs the duty of governance in international issues as well as representing Earth on the [[Galactic Community]], most nations are self governing.
