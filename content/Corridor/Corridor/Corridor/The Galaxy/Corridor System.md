The Corridor System is a network of poorly gateways that connect most of civilized space. Travel within these "Corridors" allows a properly equipped vessel to travel lightyears in mere hours while avoiding all the messy effects of time dilation. 


## History of The Corridor System

The discovery and subsequent use of a Corridor Gate is what the galactic community uses to define an advanced civilization that is fit enough to join the community. While each culture has their own theories or myths surrounding the Corridor System, noone truly understands the origin or composition of the gates and only loosely understand the mechanism by which they work.
