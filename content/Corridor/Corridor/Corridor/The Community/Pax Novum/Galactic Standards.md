Due to the diverse makeup of the [[Galactic Community]], in 12 PN, the [[Pax Novum]] decided it important to standardize most units of measurement as well as other important documents and standards. Drawing from the systems of different members of the [[Galactic Community]], the system of Galactic Standards was born. While most [[Free Stations]] use the Galactic Standards, most if not all [[Homeworld|homeworlds]] as well as [[Colonies|colonies]].


## Distance

One of the most used forms of measurement, there are 2 types of distance defined by the Galactic Standards, common distance and navigational distance.

#### Common

- Meter (m) - **Galactic Standard** (Originating from [[Earth]], a meter is defined as the distance travelled by light in a vacuum in 1/299,792,458 of a second)
- Foot (ft) - **Human** *Old East* (Originating from [[Earth]], the foot is an old unit of measurement that ceased to be used by most of the species by the 20th century CE. Many groups originating from the [[ESA]] still continue to use it out of either spite for the [[Europan Union]] or tradition)

#### Navigational

- Light Year (ly) - **Galactic Standard** (A Light Year is defined as the distance light travels within a year, most intersystem vessels use either ly or other time defined distances like Light Minutes or Light Seconds)
- Kilometer (km) - **Human** *ESA* (A much smaller navigational measurement, the kilometer is defined as 1,000 meters and as such is simple to convert to common measurements. Mainly used by planetary citizen or intrasystem vessels)
- Mile (mi) - **Human** *Old East* (Originating from the same system as the foot, the mile is defined as 5,280 ft. Rarely Used)

## Calendar Era

Most species used their own planetary orbit to track the passage of years, however with [[Humanity|Humanity's]] overwhelming influence in most [[Free Stations]] as well as the galactic stage, the passage of years was decided to be tracked by the orbit of [[Earth]] around [[Sol]]. However, many species still track eras off of different events/dates.

- Pax Novum (PN) - **Galactic Standard** - Current Year: 26
- Common Era (CE) - **Human** - Current Year: 2243
